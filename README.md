# Tkinter Grid Helper

A library which is intended to simplify a placement of widgets using grid:

- avoid manual calculation of indices of columns and rows when you add a widget;
- avoid typing-in some common parameters (like `sticky=tk.WE`) each time you add a widget;
- and more...

Work in progress.

As an example, this code:

Gives the following result:
