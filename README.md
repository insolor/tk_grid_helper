# Tkinter Grid Helper

A library which is intended to simplify a placement of widgets using grid:

- avoid manual calculation of indices of columns and rows when you add a widget;
- avoid typing-in some common parameters (like `sticky=tk.WE`) each time you add a widget;
- and more...

Work in progress.

Based on the [Grid][1] class from the [dfint][2]/[df-translation-client][3] project.
